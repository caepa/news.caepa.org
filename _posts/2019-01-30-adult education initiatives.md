**Adult Education Visioning Sessions â€“ Everyone is Welcome!**

As a continuation of the feedback work begun at the CAEPA conference and the Directors Meeting, AEI is hosting conversations about the future of adult education in Colorado in January and February (see the attached flyer). The five sessions will be structured the same way and will be held in different parts of the state in hopes that all adult education stakeholders can attend one of the sessions. The sessions will focus on what we can and want to do as a team to best serve the needs of adult learners in Colorado. Please forward the invite to your partners and stakeholders, all are welcome to attend! [Please register if you plan to attend a session.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AEIVisioning)
