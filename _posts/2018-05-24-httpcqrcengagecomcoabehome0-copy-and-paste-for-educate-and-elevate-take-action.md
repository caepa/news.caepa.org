May/June Government Relations Report


On May 22, Secretary DeVos testified before the House Education and Workforce Committee. In her prepared testimony, the Secretary repeated her challenge to all parties to "rethink school." She reported on the progress made in implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and reported that she has approved 46 plans. She also pointed to regulatory relief achieved in the K-12 space and noted that rulemaking had begun in the higher education area. She reported that work to draft new proposed regulations on sexual harassment and misconduct is well underway. She also pointed to changes being made to modernize Federal Student Aid (FSA) technology and customer service and promised further improvements in the future. She also said, "this Administration is committed to swift action to keep our nation's students and teachers safe at school," and reported that the Federal Commission on School Safety is interested in hearing from anyone "who is focused on identifying and elevating solutions." 

While she did not refer specifically to adult education, she did say "We must also rethink education after high school not to be a singular destination, but a journey with a multitude of possible and valid paths to take. We must embrace that a modern economy and society demands a model of lifelong learning, where education does not end with the movement of a tassel. We must put to rest the notion that a traditional four-year degree is the only pathway to success. Students have no shortage of dreams and aspirations, and there should be no shortage of educational pathways to help them get there."

FY 2019 Appropriations
FY 2019 is the second year of a bipartisan budget agreement that substantially raised the caps on both non-defense discretionary and defense spending. The agreement will doubtless make the appropriations process go more smoothly, but there will be inevitable bumps in the road.


Finally, the President has threatened to veto appropriations bills and shut down the government if the bills are not to his liking.

House appropriations subcommittees are beginning to consider FY19 bills. Traditionally, Congress begins with the easiest bills and leaves the most difficult ones until last. The Labor-HHS-Education bill, which funds adult education, is inevitably one of the most controversial and will be among the last bills to be considered.


We will need to continue to build on the progress we made to secure increased funding for adult education. Our Educate and Elevate campaign to reach elected officials had 77,000 contacts at last count.

Our goal for funding adult education is $664.5 million, the level authorized in WIOA for FY 2019. Please use the Ignite software at COABE.org to write your Senator or Member of Congress to urge that adult education be funded at $664.5 million, the level authorized for FY 2019 in WIOA.

It now appears that both the House and Senate subcommittees will meet to consider (or "mark-up") their bills next month. The Senate mark-up is scheduled for the week of June 25. The House date has not been announced.
Other Legislation
There are rumors that Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Chair of the Senate HELP Committee and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the Committee's Ranking Democrat have begun to discuss a CTE reauthorization. You may recall that a CTE bill passed the House but has been stuck in the Senate because Murray and Alexander disagreed about how much authority the Secretary of Education should have.
 
While Congress is capable of acting quickly when it decides to, it is beginning to look like such potentially controversial bills as the Higher Education Act reauthorization will not get done this year. 
 
Finally, on Friday, May 18, the House failed to pass the Agriculture Committee's version of the Farm bill. This is relevant to us because the Farm bill funds the SNAP program and the bill proposed significant new work requirements for SNAP recipients. It is possible that the House Republican leadership will attempt to bring the Farm bill back next week for another vote. Experts believe that the House bill cannot pass the Senate and are awaiting a Senate bill.
