The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association (CAEPA) is recognizing Cargill with its inaugural Outstanding Organization Supporting Adult Education Award, acknowledging the company's efforts to provide workplace training for more than 5,800 employees and community members through Morgan Community College's Workplace Education.

Cargill is the largest employer in Morgan County with approximately 2,150 employees. In addition to the U.S., employees working at the plant represent nearly 30 additional countries.

"Cargill is honored to receive this award and to be a part of Colorado's adult education network," said Cargill Plant General Manager Tyler Luft. "The accomplishments of the students in (MCC) Morgan Community College's Workplace Education program at our plant is an example of education as a lifelong journey."

CAEPA will present the award to Cargill on Oct. 23 at the organization's conference titled The 2018 Rendezvous, which will take place at the Double Tree by Hilton in Westminster, Colo. Cargill's Employee Experience Training Specialist Brenda Zion, will accept the award as a part of the team that made the partnership with Morgan Community College (MCC) possible.

"Cargill applauds the efforts of the students who value education and commit the time and self-discipline to learn, without whom the program could not achieve success," said Zion.

Since 1995 MCC's Workplace Education program located at the Cargill plant has offered classes in English Language Acquisition, High School Equivalency, reading, writing, math tutoring, basic computer skills, advising, college prep assessments, industry-specific classes, U.S. citizenship preparation, and transition guidance to MCC for Cargill employees and their family members. In 2017, MCC's Adult Basic Education program located on MCC's main campus reduced its classes due to funding reductions. Cargill then expanded Workplace Education by offering the program to the public to sustain the services and help meet the community need.

CAEPA provides leadership in the field of adult education and family literacy by offering opportunities for professional development, advocacy, and resource sharing to improve the quality of life for all Coloradans.
