Workplace Education and Cargill “English for the Workplace”
Presented by George O’Clair
Director of Workplace Education

Importance of English in the Workplace
“To every business entity, productivity is of utmost importance. A landslide majority of 95% of employers believed that better English would improve the productivity of employees, as opposed to the 5% who don't. It was not surprising then to find that 66% of employers have turned down applicants due to a bad command of English while a further 26% would 
do so if necessary.”
Is Education Important for Success in Companies?

Why has education become so important to employers?   
Education allows workers to:
Learn how to learn. School teaches you how to gather, learn, and apply knowledge. No matter what career you choose, you will need to learn procedures, information, and skills related to your job, and execute tasks based on that information and training.
Develop interpersonal skills. School allows you to interact with other people and refine your communication skills, including those of persuasion, conflict resolution, and teamwork.

Is Education Important for Success in Companies? (Continued)
Education allows workers to:

Learn time and task management. Learn how to manage projects, deadlines, and complete assignments efficiently and effectively.

Learn from experience of others. By attending school, you are able to learn from the experience and intellect of thousands of people who have gone before you.

“Furthering Your Employee’s Education is Good for Business”
Why would you want to pay for an employee’s education if it isn’t work-related? 
 Consider that many employees value the personal enhancement that continued education provides. Not all will see it as a chance to change careers at their employer’s expense.
 Fulfilled employees are happier employees who perform better and have increased loyalty to the employer who made this enrichment possible. And after all, isn’t that what employee benefits are all about?

Continuing Education Programs Benefit Employees and Employers
A Recent study conducted by Spherion Atlantic Enterprises LLC, a staffing and unemployment services firm, showed:

Employees who attend school while working full-time are happier on the job, more loyal to their employers, and are the best producers.

61 percent of respondents who received training said they were very likely to remain with their employer for five years or more.

Where Did it Start at Cargill?
-We first went out into our community and started speaking to corporations asking what they needed.
-23 years ago Cargill said yes to allowing Workplace Education to work with their employees.   Other major corporations at the same time said no. -Cargill is a proponent of education and realizes that employees are going to come and go.  The best thing they can do for their workers is help them to aspire to be better people, better workers, and to find their future career.    Not only does it benefit the workers, but the corporation and the community as well.
-Corporations that understand education, know that education is vital to their organization.
Orientation
Orientation at Cargill 
involves the Community:
Workplace Education presents English and Learning opportunities for new employees (We work with over 26 languages at Cargill/Workplace Education)
Employees that are interested in education are welcome to invite their family members to also be part of Workplace Education
Community Members are invited to come in and speak to New Employees and share about their businesses and what is available in the community

Working with Training Staff
“Cargill has taken advantage of a program most other companies do not offer and has allowed both Employment and Education under the same roof!”   
This allows several advantages:
Easier scheduling for daily duties
Less travel time to and from
Inexpensive classes ranging from trade school to  language learning
Smaller learning groups allowing more proportionate classes and better retention
Working together helps workers/students immerse seamlessly into the community and their jobs

Notes from Training Staff:
“Workplace Education programs allow diversity and options.  This breaks up the monotony of normal days and allows students/ workers to be enlightened by their learning capabilities.”

“Workplace Education also allows Employees to bring their family members to study and be part of the program.  Our workers appreciate this.”

“We have been fortunate to be able to utilize Teachers to help in orientation.  My hope is that we will be able to continue to offer this program to build a better future for all interested individuals at Cargill.”
