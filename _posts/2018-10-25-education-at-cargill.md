•	The Workplace Education program began in June of 1993 as a part of an 18-month Federal Department of Education Grant. Three community colleges collaborated to develop expertise in the delivery of Workplace Education. Cargill Meat Solutions was involved with the original grant.  In 1995 the state system was awarded a second expanded three-year grant which brought together six community colleges and fifteen Colorado companies. When funding was cut nationally for Workplace Education, Morgan Community College and Cargill formed a partnership to continue the program.
•	The Workplace Education program located at Cargill Meat Solutions in Fort Morgan, Colorado is a collaborative effort between Cargill Meat Solutions and Morgan Community College.
•	Our mission is to provide an environment, which is conducive to the enhancement of employee self-improvement and the opportunity for growth within the workplace and the community.  In doing so, we develop the community’s economic growth and harmony.
3.	Cargill involvement with Workplace Education
•	We first went out into our community and started speaking to corporations asking what they needed.
•	23 years ago Cargill said yes to allowing Workplace Education to work with their employees.   Other major corporations at the same time said no. 

Cargill is a proponent of education and realizes that employees are going to come and go.  The best thing they can do for their workers is help them to aspire to be better people, better workers, and to find their future career.
