This app/webtool is intended for the P5 audience; however, there are definite possibilities for all age levels.

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can we use a gamified experience to better teach reluctant learners?
  2.  Can this tool be used with ELL / ELA programs?
  3.  What are some possible uses in foreign language classes?
