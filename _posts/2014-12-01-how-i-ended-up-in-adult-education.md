Like many of you, I fell into adult education. I was teaching children and began seeing the need to provide education to their parents so the entire family could move forward. After experiencing the joy of an adult grasping new concepts and taking control of their own learning; I was hooked! Yes, I could go back to teaching children but transforming an adult's life can't compare. Without trying I became an advocate for adult education and I can't imagine my life any other way. Keep up your great work, you are needed!
