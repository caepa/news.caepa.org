## Kathryn Wisner - Morgan Community College (MCC)

Much of MCC’s service area is largely rural in nature, making access to ASE services a challenge for many students. To bridge the access gap, MCC plans to purchase two extension video conferencing systems for each of its ASE classrooms to broadcast courses to some of its remote service areas. The goal of the initiative is to partner with all the school districts in MCC’s service area to offer pathways for adult learners to earn GED® certification. Within the first year of the extension, Morgan Community College plans to increase its reach by 100%. “This initiative will bring adult secondary education courses to seven counties in eastern Colorado, will reach twenty-two school districts in MCC’s service area, and will impact the lives of adults in rural American who want the opportunity for a better life,” states Kathryn Wisner.
