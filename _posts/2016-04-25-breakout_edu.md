I am going to show you a gamified “research” project using a wooden box with multiple padlocks. It is called Breakout EDU. In the video, you will see a great way to add elements of challenge, competitiveness, fun, and rewards to a traditional way of doing research. More information about the box, games, and an educational community that develops games can be found by visiting [breakoutedu.com](http://www.breakoutedu.com/).

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can “gamification” engage our students?
  2.  Can you think of a time in k12 that the teacher used a game to teach or review a topic?  Did it motivate you to learn more? Why were you more engaged?
  3.  In what ways can you use gamification to engage your learners, whether they are students or adults?
