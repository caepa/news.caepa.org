Hello Directors and Staff,

We are excited to let you know that this year’s conference **From Here to There** will be the first of its kind. The conference will have five strands. This year CAPEA will host two new innovative strands. One Educate and Elevate, which will focus on an adult learner strand, Adult Learner Voices. This strand will showcase our new adult education learner advocates who will share their stories through a panel discussion and later run a café style presentation to help adult program staff understand challenges that limit recruitment and retention. During the café presentation participants will work with adult learners to create solutions to incorporate into their programs. The second strand will be part of the COABE Virtual Conference. This year we will provide a room to showcase the Virtual Conference. The room will include charging stations for all electronics, discussion space, sign up/in laptops and large screen project for the presentations.

For details on the conference, CAEPA is holding:

 * CAEPA Conference Monday, October 22, 2018 through Wednesday, October 24, 2018 at the Doubletree in Westminster Colorado
 * CAEPA Pre-Conference Session: Adult Education Ambassadors Train the Trainer on Monday, October 22, 2018

Room rates and continental breakfasts are $118 a night when you mention the CAEPA conference.

Registration to CAEPA is $175 for the two days including breakfast and lunch. If you attended the Mini CAEPA conference, registration will be $125, snack and lunch are included with all registrations.

This will be an exciting Conference with four very talented and connected keynote speakers. Register early. More updates to come.

CAEPA President,
