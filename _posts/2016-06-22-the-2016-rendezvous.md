Dear Colleagues:

As we embark in another year of changes and growth, we are challenged to provide guidance to our educators who are always seeking more professional knowledge for our adult learners.

Adult educators are forever reaching for more sustaining ways to motivate and captivate our audiences.

I would encourage you to be innovative and creative in your methods of delivery. With the transition to WIOA and the partnerships being created with pathways to success, we can only imagine the uplift this will give our students.

Our strands this year are varied and flexible; yet address multiple topics. I invite you to join us; to share your knowledge, experience, and incredible creativity with our colleagues around the state.

Thank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge to empower educators and learners, so we can, as a team, build partnerships to strengthen our communities.
