Today's #TechTipTuesday video will show you a great way to make interactive images that can act as a teaching/training tool. The tool is Thinglink and it allows you to tag images with text boxes, more images, videos, and web links.  All of these tags are embedded directly into the image; which makes it come to life with your explanations and scaffolds learning with links to outside sources.

Items to consider while watching:
  
  1.  How can interactive images increase engagement in the classroom or during training sessions?
  2.  Can interactive images help with differentiation?
  3.  How can you use tools like Thinglink to assist emerging readers?
  4.  Can your students / audience benefit from an image that guides them to “dig deeper”?
  5.  How can this tool be used to assist students in the use of primary source documents and images?
