On November 3-4, 2017 two, TSJC Adult Education Services ESL Instructors attended CoTESOL’S 41st annual convention in Denver, Colorado. The Theme was “Launching the Future, Reaching the Stars.” More than 130 presentations-speakers were invited from different states such as California,  Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, and Florida. Also in attendance were representatives from 13 Asian countries whom were involved with U.S. State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program.

Friday, November 3, Sessions ESL Instructors attended were mainly pertaining to English Language Learners (ELL) in Adult Basic Education (ABE). Sessions titled: “Speak Up! Building Confidence in ELL’s, Walking in Our Newcomers Shoes, Supporting Students with Undocumented/DACA/ASSET Statuses in Higher Education, Academic Languages: It’s More Than Just Words, Using Pronunciation in the Adult ESL Class, and Student Anxiety: How You Can Help.”

Saturday, November 4, Sessions attended were: “Teaching Adult Refugees With Limited Schooling, An Active Learning Journey in Adult ESL, Five Free Websites For Enhancing Reading Skills, and Get Students Speaking With Fluency and Confidence.”

Sessions that were attended were beneficial. The favored Sessions were: “Using Pronunciation in the Adult ESL Class presented by utilizing Intercambio Uniting Communities booklets; An Active Learning Journey in Adult ESL.”

One of the most useful sessions was “The Grammar You Need for Academic Writing” presented by Michael Berman from Mountain College, Rockville, MD, Language Arts Press. He gave grammar cards to follow along as he did his presentation on core content selected grammar. The presentation was excellent and we purchased the three card series which we are already using for instruction.
