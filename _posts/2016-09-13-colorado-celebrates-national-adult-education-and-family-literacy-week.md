## September 26 - October 1, 2016
**\#ColoradoLiteracy2016**, **\#AEFLWeek**

Dear Colleagues,

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association (CAEPA) and the Literacy Coalition of Colorado (LCC) partnered to join groups from across the country to raise public awareness of the need and value of adult and family literacy programs and lifelong learning. National Adult Education and Family Literacy Week is an opportunity to advocate for resources and support for 36 million U.S adults with low literacy skills [www.coabe.org](http://www.coabe.org/adult-education-is-needed-now/).

Here in Colorado, AEFL Week is an opportunity to also highlight the important work we contribute to our state’s growing economy and neighborhoods through adult and family literacy. Each of you play a critical role in promoting adult literacy by helping adult learners across our beautiful state who need to strengthen their basic literacy and math skills, improve their English, study for High School Equivalency diploma, and prepare for community college or vocational training.

Celebrating student successes by sponsoring and participating in the one of the following activities throughout the week:

1. Post selfies of your students engaged in any adult literacy activity to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram using **\#ColoradoLiteracy2016**, **\#AEFLWeek** to begin a state-wide awareness trending campaign.

2. Adult Education students and alumni can post brief reflections about their “keys to success” on the [Colorado Adult Education Professional Association](https://www.facebook.com/caepa.co/) and [Literacy Coalition of Colorado](https://www.facebook.com/Literacy-Coalition-of-Colorado-251935441595829/) Facebook pages. Student reflections can highlight the teachers, mentors or family members who encouraged or inspired them along their journey.

3. Contact your policymakers to enact this Proclamation for National Adult and Family Literacy Week 2016 in your area.

4. Adult Education instructors can implement reading-focused activities such as library tours, maximizing
library resources, book reports and presentations and post images at **\#ColoradoLiteracy2016**, **\#AEFLWeek**.
