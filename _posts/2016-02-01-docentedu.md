This web-tool is a reimagined version of the old-fashioned webquest. You can take any webpage and add your content in the form of text-based instructions, quizzes, embedded videos, inserted images, and even discussion threads.  This could be a powerful tool for teachers and trainers!

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can guidance while using the internet increase learning?
  2.  Can interactive tech elements make research lesson more interactive?
  3.  How can you use guided activities that are embedded into a webpage to shift from direct instruction teaching model to a facilitation model?
  4.  Can tools like DocentEDU make flipped-teaching more effective?

  2.  The first 5 DocentEDU lessons are free.
  3.  Your users need the free DocentEDU app if they use a mobile device. On a computer, they will need to use Chrome or Firefox.
