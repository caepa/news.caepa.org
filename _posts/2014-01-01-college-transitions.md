Meet Juan Peng, an adult learner at Colorado Mountain College in Dillon. Originally from Jiangsu Province, China, Juan moved to Summit County with her husband in 2003. She attended an advanced ESL class at the college to adapt to her new life and especially "explain feelings, understand media, and have more meaningful communication."

After ten years and two children, (now in 2nd and 4th grades), Juan decided to return to school. She wanted to change careers (because “anyone can be a waitress”), feel like a success, and finish the degree she had started in China. She took a placement exam and two semesters of developmental education to attain a college level proficiency in reading and writing.

This semester, she is taking a full load of college-level classes including mathematics, biology, and English composition! She plans to eventually obtain a BA in nursing.
