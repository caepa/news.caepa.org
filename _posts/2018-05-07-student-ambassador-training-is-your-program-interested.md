Adult Education Ambassadors Train the Trainer

CAEPA Pre-Conference Session Monday, October 22, 2018

Ambassadors become representational leaders by developing their voice so they can effectively represent other students and take action for social change on issues they care about.

CAEPA’s Student Ambassadors Task Force wants to establish teams of trainers from programs around the state: Director/Administrator + Staff/Instructor + Student Leader

Ambassador Training 4 Components

  * Awareness – statistics and research about the value of adult basic education
  * Stories – most powerful tool to affect change
  * Public speaking – message and delivery
  * Meeting with officials – planning, practicing, facilitating meetings with people in power

Goals

  * Develop role and identity as a representational leader
  * Provide students with skills for college & career success
  * Increase visibility of adult education
  * Offer networking for students – current and alumni
  * Heighten the impact of Educate & Elevate with trained student leaders who are ready to deliver their powerful stories
