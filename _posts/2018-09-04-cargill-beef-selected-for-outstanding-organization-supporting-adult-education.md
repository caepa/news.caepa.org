CAEPA will present the award to Cargill on October 23rd at the organization’s conference titled The 2018 Rendezvous.  Brenda Zion, Employee Experience Training Specialist will be accepting the award on behalf of Cargill and the Fort Morgan facility’s past and present management team  that has made the partnership with Morgan Community College (MCC) possible.  Cargill applauds the efforts of past and present Workplace Education coordinators, directors, teachers and administrative staff and, most importantly, the students who have valued education and committed the time and self-discipline to learn, without whom the program would not have achieved success. 

 

Since 1995 MCC’s Workplace Education program located at the Cargill plant has offered classes in English Language Acquisition; High School Equivalency exam; reading, writing and math tutoring; basic computer skills; advising and college prep; assessments; industry-specific ; U.S. citizenship preparation; and transition guidance to MCC’s on-campus for Cargill employees and their family members.  In 2017, MCC’s Adult Basic Education program located on MCC’s main campus reduced its classes due to funding reductions. Cargill then expanded Workplace Education by offering the program to the public to sustain the services and help meet the community need.  More can be learned about MCC’s Workplace Education on MCC’s website (https://www.morgancc.edu/).
