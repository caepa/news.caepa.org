  Morgan Community College recently started the Industrial Electrical/Mechanical
  Maintenance Program, which had its first graduate, Brent Hammer. The program
  was a collaboration of Morgan County businesses and George O’Clair who saw the
  current need for employees with industrial electrical/mechanical Maintenance
  (IEMM) skills. An award was given by Mountain Plains Adult Educational
  Association (MPAEA) to O’Clair for spearheading this program.  Mountain Plains
  picks one individual in each state to receive an award of excellence yearly.
  The award recognized the pathway to the IEMM trade. It is projected that the
  demand for these careers will grow 17% by 2022. Therefore, this is an
  excellent choice in which to gain a certificate or to earn an associate of
  applied science degree.  Additionally, students can earn up to 2000 hours
  toward an electrical Journeyman apprentice program.   There are also local
  industry partners who have internships available to successful students.  
  Morgan Community College is very proud of Brent Hammer, and wishes him luck as
  he pursues this career path.
