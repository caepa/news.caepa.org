title: Final Push for Funding
---
## Deadline April 11, 2018

**Is your state afraid to raise their hand for adult ed?**

 As we celebrate the success of the additional $35 million for adult education, the first funding increase of its kind since 2002, we are reminded that there is a unique opportunity to access additional funding which would impact our field significantly. Because states must match federal allocations, the funding increased at the federal level impacts the funding at the state level. In essence, when you advocate at the federal level, you are also impacting state funding as well.

 To that end, our recent advocacy efforts resulted in a "Dear Colleague Letter" being introduced into the Senate. The following Senators below have signed on, and the deadline for sign on is April 11th. If your state is not represented, we encourage you to forward this email [HERE](http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Take-Action-.html?soid=1112004712009&aid=MNZE_0O6V_I) to your members. The more senators that sign on, the greater the chance that our funding will be increased.

  * Reed (RI)
  * Blumenthal (CT)
  * Coons (DE)
  * Warrens (MA)
  * Shaheen (NH)
  * Duckworth (IL)
  * Hassan (NH)
  * Stabenow (MI)
  * Whitehouse (RI)
  * Baldwin (WI)
  * Hirono (HI)
  * Gillibrand (NY)

 At this critical time, we hope that you will encourage members in your state to raise their hand for adult ed with 3 quick clicks. They can call or email their legislators [HERE](http://cqrcengage.com/coabe/home?0). Working together as a field we are making a difference!
