Morgan Community College recently started the Industrial Electrical/Mechanical
Maintenance Program, which had its first graduate, Brent Hammer. The program
was a collaboration of Morgan County businesses and George O’Clair who saw the
current need for employees with industrial electrical/mechanical Maintenance
(IEMM) skills. An award was given by Mountain Plains Adult Educational
Association (MPAEA) to O’Clair for spearheading this program. Mountain Plains
picks one individual in each state to receive an award of excellence yearly.
The award recognized the pathway to the IEMM trade. It is projected that the
demand for these careers will grow 17% by 2022. Therefore, this is an
excellent choice in which to gain a certificate or to earn an associate of
applied science degree. Additionally, students can earn up to 2000 hours
toward an electrical Journeyman apprentice program. There are also local
industry partners who have internships available to successful students.
Morgan Community College is very proud of Brent Hammer, and wishes him luck as
he pursues this career path.
