Hello CAEPA membership,

We hope you are enjoying your summer and looking forward to fall sessions. Our conference theme is: MOVING IT FORWARD. Consider what you need to move forward regarding your students, program and professionally. Some suggestions from last year's conference were more information regarding: low level learners, corrections, grants, and ELA but strands are not limited to these topics.
