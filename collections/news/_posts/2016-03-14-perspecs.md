This video will show you a free app for Apple and Android devices called Perspecs. This free app provides readers with three different perspectives on the same story.

{% include_relative embed-media.html id=page.video-url %}

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can reading different perspectives of a story give our students a complete picture of a topic?
  2.  Can apps like these be used in the standard “controversial issues” research projects that appear in every high school?
  3.  Do apps like these guide us in developing our information and digital literacy skills?
