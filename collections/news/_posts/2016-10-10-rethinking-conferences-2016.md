**Rationale:** Reduced budgets and the need to connect locally have made a centralized, two-day conference expensive and restricts partner participation.

**Proposal:** CAEPA provides support for regionalized conferences. Programs can apply to host a conference and CAEPA can support through advertising, registration, logistics, and finances.

**Advantages for Programs:**

 * Financial support for local efforts
 * Lower cost for conference attendance (travel and hotel)
 * Can still invite outside presenters (proposal could fund them)
 * Can still attend other regional conferences
 * Local partners more likely to attend
 * Focus can be on what the region needs
 * Timing can best meet regional needs (travel, breaks, etc.)

**Obligations for Programs:**

 * Must write a proposal to receive CAEPA funding
 * Must allow for all CAEPA members statewide to attend if desired
 * Must provide follow-up data (attendees and evaluations)
 * Must have local support for logistics (registration, food, space, etc.)

**CAEPA could:**

 * Support through online registration and/or fee collection and then forward to host program
 * Share the workload as we have board members in most parts of the state
 * Create a clearinghouse of top speakers by topic
 * Connect with relevant vendors for additional resources
 * Make the application process simple and streamlined so some regions may host multiple mini-conferences each year

**NOTE:** This is a proposal only. ==No decisions have been made.== To share your opinions, please attend the CAEPA business meeting on Friday morning at 8:00.
