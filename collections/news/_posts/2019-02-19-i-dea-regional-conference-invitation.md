In partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges Basic Education for Adults is pleased to announce that an I-DEA regional two-day conference will be offered in Sacramento, California on March 21 & 22, 2019 at the Courtyard Sacramento Cal Expo.

This conference will equip English language faculty and administrators with practical information and hands-on tools to successfully implement and deliver I-DEA at their locations. The I-DEA flipped classroom hybrid model provides a year of free, professionally developed open source curriculum that prepares low level English Language Learners (ESL 1-3) to enter college and career pathways with digital literacy and academic, employability, and English language acquisition skills. I-DEAâ€™s federal level gain outcomes have been consistently 16 percent higher than traditional English language classrooms over the past four years.

There are no registration fees for the conference, and breakfast and lunch are provided. The cost to attendees is travel, dinner, and lodging.  Further details can be found on the [I-DEA National Conference page](https://www.sbctc.edu/colleges-staff/programs-services/i-dea/idea-conferences.aspx) on the [SBCTC Website](https://www.sbctc.edu/).
