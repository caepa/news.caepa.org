When I was in graduate school a friend of mine encouraged me to teach a class at Right to Read Adult Education Center. Before visiting the school, I thought “adult education” was a song by Hall & Oates, but by the end of one semester I had fallen in love with adult learners, many of whom I’m lucky to still call friends. I taught ESL levels 3 and 4 for Right to Read for two years while teaching composition classes at the colle-giate level. When the opportunity to become the director of our program pre-sented itself, I was excited about the possibility of impacting learners and educators on a larger scale but nervous about leaving the classroom. My co-workers and other colleagues around the state have helped me settle into this role and sometimes my staff even lets me teach a class with them. I feel ex-tremely fortunate to work with such amazing people both in our program and other adult education programs in Colorado. We are a bizarre and won-derful group united in our passion to empower adults through education.
