The Mountain Plains Adult Education Association serves members in a nine-state region: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, and North Dakota. Each state sends two representatives to the Board of Directors. Directors serve for a term of three years. Board members meet in regular conference calls; MPAEA supports state conferences in its region, typically one per year. Representatives to the board benefit from the opportunity to collaborate and learn from colleagues and programs in other states. We bring together all different aspects of the field, with the mission of promoting lifelong learning by supporting quality professional development.

Colorado is seeking a new representative; please contact Karen Bowen,
 <bowenk@boulderlibrary.org>, if you are interested! You can learn more, too, at <http://mpaea.org>.

Our conference is coming up soon, April 12-13. MPAEA awards one $260 conference scholarship per state. Scholarship and conference registration information can be found on the website. I hope to see you there!

Thanks,
Karen Bowen
CO MPAEA Representative
