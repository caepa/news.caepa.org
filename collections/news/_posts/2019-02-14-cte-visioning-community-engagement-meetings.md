 * What essential skills, knowledge, and abilities will employees need in 5-10 years?
 * How can we make sure every student in Colorado has access to information about and training for careers that align with their skills and interests?

As CCCS looks to the future, these are some of the questions we’re tackling to support education and workforce development systems, improve people’s lives, and improve our state’s economy. Your voice matters!

Join us for a conversation about the future of CTE in Colorado.  CTE is the talent strategy system that builds technical and academic skills and knowledge for middle school, high school, and community college students to succeed in in-demand, high skill, high wage careers throughout Colorado. It is an integral component of CO’s workforce and economic success.  We need you!
