This app allows you to send group texts from your mobile device.  A text message is a form of communication that most people use; however, it is not widely used in a school setting.  With this app, you can send texts without giving up your cell phone number!

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can texts be used to keep your parents up-to-date?
  2.  Can text messages keep your students and parents more engaged?
  3.  Are there other forms of communication we can use to ensure our students and parents are prepared for our classes?
