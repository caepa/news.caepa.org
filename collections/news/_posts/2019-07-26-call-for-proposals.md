Hello CAEPA membership,

We hope you are enjoying your summer and looking forward to fall sessions. Our conference theme is: MOVING IT FORWARD. Consider what you need to move forward regarding your students, program and professionally. Some suggestions from last year's conference were more information regarding: low level learners, corrections, grants, and ELA but strands are not limited to these topics.

CAEPA 2019 Rendezvous conference will be Friday, October 11th and Saturday, October 12th at Aims Community College in Greeley.

Proposals are due: August 15th, 2019

We look forward to seeing what the brilliant educators in Colorado have to share!

## Presentation Proposal

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, CAEPA, invites you to submit a proposal for the 2019 Rendezvous. This year’s theme is, “Moving It Forward” and we have thought up a list of new session strands to take us there. Sessions are 1 hour and 15 minutes each.
