Free, online backchannel chat service called TodaysMeet. Backchannel chats are great for conferences, large classrooms, or classes that are connecting from different areas / rooms.

{% include_relative embed-media.html id=page.video-url %}

Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can backchannel chats help with engagement in the classroom (or at a conference)?
  2.  Can backchannel chats be used to drive &/or differentiate instruction?
  3.  Can backchannel chats assist in communication when classes are in different rooms, towns, states, or countries?
  4.  Are there other forms of digital communication we can use to give our students a voice in the classroom?
