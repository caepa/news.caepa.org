The [Workforce Diploma Pilot Program (HB19-1236)](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1236) passed in the most recent legislative session creates another opportunity for the approximately 350,000 adults ages 21 and older without a high school credential in Colorado to earn a diploma and other workforce/education-related credentials. The legislature appropriated approximately $1 million of state general funds for the pilot in 2019-20 and the request for qualifications must be released this August.

The State Board of Education may adopt rules for the implementation of the program, so the Colorado Department of Education is seeking input from all interested stakeholders about the implementation of the Workforce Diploma Pilot at a public meeting next Thursday, July 18, 2019, 1:15 p.m. â€“ 2:15 p.m.

Interested stakeholders may attend in-person or via the conference line. To ensure there is adequate space for all who wish to attend, whether in person or on the phone, please [RSVP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WorkforceDiplomaPilot) as soon as possible. Anyone who is unable to participate may email input to Danielle Ongart <ongart_d@cde.state.co.us> by Friday, July 19, 2019.
