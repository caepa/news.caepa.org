## We need your help

On February 9, President Trump signed a Continuing Resolution that includes significant increases in Non-defense Discretionary spending and offers the opportunity to increase funding for Adult Education, among other programs. Now, each Appropriations Committee must decide how to allocate its new funds. **We believe that this is a unique opportunity to increase funding for Adult Education by $100 million (a roughly 17 percent increase) from about $582 million to about $682 million.**

**Update**

On March 22, the Congress agreed and the President signed an Omnibus Appropriations bill that included an additional $35 million in funding for Adult Education. As a result, Adult Education will be funded at $631 million rather than $596 million. This increase of almost six percent is the first for Adult Education since 2002. It is important to note that even with this increase, Adult Education funding is still almost $20 million below the level authorized in WIOA ($649 million). Now Congress turns its attention to FY19. We believe that Adult Education should be funded at the level authorized in WIOA for FY19 or $664.5 million.

This increase shows the power of your hard work and the power of our message. We must continue to work together to reach the level originally authorized in WIOA, and we need your help to do this. Please take action below.
