The passing of the proposed Adult Education and Literacy Act of 2014, HB 14-1085, will give organizations the funding to educate more adults who are in need of a basic level of literacy and numeracy knowledge, technical skill training, or post-secondary education.

In addition to benefiting Coloradoâ€™s unemployed, the workforce will benefit by retaining jobs and advancing in careers. Many Colorado adults are in need of the following:

 * High School Equivalency certification
 * technical training
 * knowledge of college education opportunities
